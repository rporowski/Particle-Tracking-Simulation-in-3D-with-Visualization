# Particle-Tracking-Simulation-in-3D-with-Visualization
This repository contains a Python-based simulation of particle tracking through a series of detector planes. The simulation models particles emitted from a single source, which propagate along straight trajectories. The system is designed to mimic a simplified particle collision experiment with detectors placed at fixed intervals along the z-axis.
Features
Particle Generation:
Particles are emitted uniformly in spherical angles (theta and phi) from the origin (0, 0, 0).
Trajectories are simulated in 3D space as straight lines.
Detector Plane Setup:

Six detector planes perpendicular to the z-axis are placed at user-defined positions (default: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm).
Each plane has a 10x10 cmÂ² area.
Trajectory Filtering:

Particles that intersect all six planes are recorded for further analysis.
Intersection points (x, y, z) are calculated for valid trajectories.
Visualization:

A 3D animation of the particle trajectories is created using matplotlib.animation.
Each trajectory is progressively added to the visualization to simulate real-time particle tracking.
Simulation Output
The simulation generates:

3D Animation: A video (particle_simulation.mp4) showing the particle trajectories intersecting the detector planes.
Tracking Data: Coordinates of intersection points for valid trajectories are stored during the simulation and can be extended for further processing, such as machine learning-based trajectory reconstruction.
Example Visualization

Example: A simulation of particles propagating through six detector planes.

Future Enhancements
Data Export: Save intersection points in CSV format for external analysis.
Machine Learning Integration: Implement tracking algorithms to reconstruct trajectories from intersection points.
Realistic Physics: Incorporate noise and particle scattering for a more realistic simulation.
